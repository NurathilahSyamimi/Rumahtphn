  		<div class="text">An overview of<br> what we do
		<p>We provide services that can make it easier <br>for residents and visitors to use any service<br> from us.
		Not only that, in terms of interior,<br> we provide service for the children so that <br>they are more comfortable and happy when<br> they are in this house.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="service">
		<div class="point">1. Care and Protection
		<p>This orphanage will always look after the welfare of the children because after the death of a family member, they desperately need a place where they can always be cared for, protected and loved</p></div>

		<div class="point">2. Guidance and Counseling 
		<p>Guidance counselling, also known as counselling and guidance, is the act of assisting people in discovering and realising their educational, professional, and psychological potentialities in order to maximise their degree of enjoyment and social contribution</p></div>

		<div class="point">3. Religious and Morals 
		<p>The terms morality and religion signify two interrelated but separate concepts in the opinion of many people. Religion largely focuses on the interaction between people and a transcendent reality, whereas morality is supposed to relate to how human affairs are conducted and interpersonal relationships</p></div>



	</div>

	<div class="service">
		<div class="point">4. Education
		<p>Education is the field that examines how to educate and learn in classrooms or surroundings that are similar to classrooms, as opposed to using different informal and informal socialisation approaches</p></div>

		<div class="point">5. Activities In and Outside
		<p>Such activities should be done in orphanages because with that, they can communicate, cooperate and get to know each other. If there is free time, the caretaker will take them to do outdoor activities such as exercising, playing badminton, doing activities according to the schedule and more</p></div>

		<div class="point">6. Medical Treatment and Health
		<p>Medical care refers to the management and attention given to the children in order to treat a condition. The children will always be given medical treatment in the event of injury, fever, illness and so on. with this, their welfare will always be taken care of and all their needs will always be provided for</p></div>

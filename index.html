				<h1>LOVING</h1>
				<p>Love is very much needed by all human beings especially for those who have lost the love of their loved ones. 
				Which can be taken as an example, an orphan who has lost his parents or siblings should be given as much love as possible. 
				This is to prevent them from feeling lonely, depressed or feeling give up with their lives. 
				John M. Simmons stated in his quote that "Orphanages are the only places that ever left me feeling empty and full at the same time." 
				Clearly shows that anyone who visits an orphanage, they will definitely feel sad after listening to their story but when they share love together, they will forget that sadness. 
				In Islam it says, Improving the condition of the orphans is very good and if you mix with them (then there is no harm) because they are your brothers (who are in religion) 
				and Allah knows the spoilers (their property) than those who want fix it. And if Allah willed, He could have burdened you. Allah is Mighty, Wise. "(Surah al-Baqarah, verse 220)</p>

				<h1>RIGHT</h1>
				<p>Islam obliges Muslims to always pay attention, do good, take care, and nurture orphans until adulthood.
				Islam also places a very special value on people who actually carry out the commandments and teaches to empathize by giving love to orphans. In Islam, there are several rights of orphans that must be met, such as:</p>
					<ol type="1">
  						<li>Educated and Fed</li>
						<p>Orphans are entitled to the love and food they deserve on a daily basis.
						Allah SWT says: "Did you know that someone who denies the Religion, that is someone who rebukes an orphan, and does not recommend feeding the poor." (QS. Al-Ma’un: 1 3).</p>
 					<li>Well Treated</li>
						<p>In addition, those who belong to orphans also need to be treated well.
						Allah SWT says:"So against an orphan, then do not act arbitrarily. And do not rebuke the beggar. " (QS Ad-Dhuha: 9-10).</p>
  					<li>Sufficient for their needs</li>
						<p>A hadith from Ibn Abbas RA says that the Prophet SAW said:
						"Whoever feeds and drinks an orphan among the Muslims, then Allah will admit him to paradise, unless he commits an unforgivable sin."</p>
 					<li>Rights in Property Matters</li>
						<p>The meaning is the prohibition to spend the property that the orphan has outside the purpose of his welfare.
						This is in accordance with the words of Allah SWT:"And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in a more beneficial way until he is an adult." (QS Al-An’am: 152).</p>
 					<li>Receiving Inheritance Rights</li>
						<p>After being abandoned by his father, an orphan must receive his inheritance. The portion of the inherited property that he receives must be taken care of by his 
						guardian or guardian. The property must be returned to the orphan when he or she is an adult.</p>
					</ol>  
			</div>


			<div id="C">
				<h1>CHARITY</h1>
				<p>Helping is an attitude that must be present in human beings that can make others happy. As a point, charity is part of helping out. Giving alms to orphans is 
				highly encouraged because with that, we can help them financially and in need as well. By giving alms, a miracle will happen where we will always be blessed, get peace of mind, be happy in this world and 
				the hereafter and get a great reward. Giving alms to orphans can also avoid disaster and distress. This is in accordance with the words of the Prophet SAW who said that there is no disaster and 
				disaster that can precede alms. At the same time, he also revealed that almsgiving is able to close 70 doors of evil, (H.R Imam Baihaqi). Therefore, do not be afraid when spending some of our wealth in the way of God. 
				Because of God's mathematical theory, giving as little as anything will be replaced many times over. As long as God gives us the opportunity to breathe fresh air, it is not too late to glorify orphans.</p>

			<h2>What the advantages of giving alms to an orphan?</h2>
				<ol type="1">
  					<li>Cultivate a sense of meekness in the heart</li>
 					<li>Adding to the gratitude for the gifts of parents that still exist</li>
 				 	<li>Stay away from the nature of stinginess, stinginess, arrogance and arrogance</li>
 					<li>Being one of the forms of loving fellow creatures of God</li>
 					<li>Being one of the good deeds that can weigh on the scales of deeds in the hereafter</li>
				</ol>

			</div>

			<div id="H">
				<h1>HAPPINESS</h1>
				<p>What is happiness? happiness is where we always have a feeling of being excited with someone or something. 
				To make people happy is not difficult because it often happens around us. the person who makes the orphan happy 
				will always be viewed as pure and respected. This orphan is a group whose half of their happiness is gone. 
				Therefore, our role is to strengthen their spirit and always be in their arms. Happiness that results from kindness is contagious and eternal. 
				The youngsters help us understand that possessing luxuries, pricy games, or designer clothes does not guarantee happiness. 
				By giving selflessly and sharing one's joys and sufferings with others, it involves making someone else happy.
			 	The pandemic made us realise how important it is to spread joy and love to everyone around us. Before the pandemic, we barely ever spent meaningful time with anyone, 
				not even with our own family. Spending time with elderly folks, children, or those who are homeless makes both the giver and the recipient happy. 
				Serving others is a form of self-service. Our happiness grows when we share it. Although we are unaware of the level of joy a child might experience from simply having fun with strangers, 
				we should all make a commitment to pay more frequent visits to them because our time is the greatest gift we can give them.</p>
